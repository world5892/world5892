Hi! My name's Rafa≈Ç and I'm from Poland.
I've been studying web development for about 5 years. During this time I've learnt HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. 
JavaScript is the centre of my interests and now I'm trying to learn Node.js and MongoDB so that in the future I can become a full-stack developer.
My repositories reflect what courses I have done so far and the projects I have gone through (some of them several times).
Currently I am building my own portfolio website and looking for a job as a front-end web developer.
