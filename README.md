Hi! My name's Rafa≈Ç and I'm from Poland.
I've been exploring web development for a couple of years. During this time I've mainly learnt HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript and React. 
JavaScript is the centre of my interests and now I'm learning learn Node.js so that in the future I can become a full-stack developer.
My repositories reflect what courses I have done so far and the projects I have gone through (some of them several times).
Currently I am working on another React project and looking for a job as a front-end web developer.
